    <h2 class = "desc"> Hi! My name is William Truong and I am a 14 year old (current) student at Oakland Military Institute. I live in Oakland, California. Currently in the 2019 summer, I am attending a course named Mission Bit. It really gave me a good perspective/outlook about how websites are created and what is contained inside it. </h2>

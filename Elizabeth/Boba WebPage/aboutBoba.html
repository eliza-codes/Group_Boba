        <p>What is boba? It is commonly referred to as the whole drink although, boba is really the tapioca pearls in
            your drink. How many drinks do we buy weekly. According to an Instagram poll conducted by a student from
            Houston College, students drink an average of four cups per week. </p>

        <h3>Nutritional Facts</h3>

        <p>Why is drinking boba four times a week much? Well boba is consisted of added sugar, fructose and syrups. In a
            serving of a half cup (76g), there is 0.8mg of sodium, 8.5mg of potassium, 67.5g of carbs, 0.7g of dietary
            fibers, 2.5g of sugar and 0.1g of protein. There aren’t many nutrients provided in your drink. It is almost
            safe to say that there aren’t any nutrients at all. What happened to your vitamins? Well, depending how your
            drink is made, there are no natural ingredients and a lot of extra artificial flavoring.</p>

        <p>If you are the type of person to not exercise regularly, you might even gain weight from drinking boba. It
            sounds a bit ridiculous but it is true. Sugar is included in your drink so imagine drinking this beverage
            four times a week and sitting the majority of the time. The excess sugar will sit in your body and will turn
            into fat. That is how your start to gain weight. But if you drink boba four times a week for an extended
            period of time, you are risking yourself to health issues. </p>

        <h3>Health Risks</h3>

        <p>So you are drinking four bobas per week. You love it because of the flavoring and the extra toppings on the
            side. Drinking boba is very similar to drinking soda. If you drink too much, you are risking yourself to
            diabetes and heart problems. Remember the student I mentioned earlier from Houston College? She suffered
            from a minor heart attack.</p>

        <p>According to an article written from Harvard university, too much sugar is an invitation to cardiovascular
            disease. In 2014, JAMA International Medicine released a study conducted by Dr. Hu. Apparently, a high sugar
            diet has a tie with a risk of death from heart disease. Sugar can become calories while being digested by
            your body. Additionally, 17% to 21% of sitting calories will leave you with a 38% higher risk of dying from
            cardiovascular disease.</p>

        <p>Well what if you are a scholar athlete but drink so much boba? The sugar will enter through your bloodstream.
            Your body needs calories in order to function but an over consumption of sugar can lead to high blood sugar
            levels. If left untreated and you continue your boba drinking habits, the result will be diabetes. This is
            just plain sad because that means you will be limited form any sugar treats, this includes your favorite
            candies and soda drinks.
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>

        <p>This is a nice step to a healthier body and a happier wallet. You will have saved so much money and now you
            can buy anything you desire. Just don’t buy another boba. It is nice to have this drink as a treat. Maybe
            after you paid your rent, you can treat yourself to some sweets. Now you’re are a little closer to a
            healthier lifestyle. Good job!</p>

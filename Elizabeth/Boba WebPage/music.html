        <p class="radioDes">Most boba shops always have music playing. Some shops play the latest hits and others tend
                to play older hits
                from the 20th century. If we were to open a boba shop, we would play both time periods of songs. We have
                gathered a list of songs of what we think are great hits. There are 10 songs from each time period we
                for sure would want to include.</p>

        <p class="radioFunc">This page does not function like an autoplay radio like Pandora or Spotify. The best thing to do is to play
                the songs one by one. If you would like to download one song, the icon to download the music file is on
                the far right of the music controller.</p>

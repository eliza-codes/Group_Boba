    <h1 class = "will"> About William </h1>

    <p class = "thisSectionn"> Hi! My name is William Truong and I am a 14 year old (current) student at Oakland Military Institute. I live in Oakland, California. Currently in the 2019 summer, I am attending a course named Mission Bit. It really gave me a good perspective/outlook about how websites are created and what is contained inside it. </p>

    <p class = "thisSectionn"> My favorite songs are Hungry Eyes by Eric Carmen, Hello by Lionel Richie, and the Soundtrack from the movie "A Bridge Too Far." </p>

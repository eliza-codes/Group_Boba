        <p>Hello! My name is Elizabeth and I am the person behind this entire website. I hope you enjoy clicking around.
            I
            personally made this website because I noticed that the majority of my friends enjoy drinking boba, I do
            too!
            Although, I think my friends drink this beverage quite often. So I decided to make an informational site
            about
            boba. I made this website during the summer of 2019 while in Mission Bit. I found out about this program
            through
            a close friend of mine. I was able to practice my HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

        <p>I am currently a high school student expecting to graduate in the year 2022. During my time in middle school
            and
            my first year of high school, I was developing and practicing my leadership skills in OMI. During my free
            time,
            I would either attend classes hosted by Girls Who Code or volunteering at my local library.
        </p>

        <p>I like to listen to music and do so literally everyday. I am a big fan of One Direction and recently got into
            Astro. My favorite songs by One Direction are Perfect, Walking in the Wind, and Infinity. My favorite songs
            by
            Astro are All Night, Crazy Sexy Cool, and Innocent Love.</p>

        <p>I hope you got to know me a little and I hope you find this website helpful in any way.</p>
